- Today, while learning React for Front-End Web Development, I learned a new feature and that is about when using useEffect for state management, what if I use Key Props instead. It's good approach while using Key props for state management instead of using useEffect in Case of parent Child Scenario. Using useEffect slows down the rendering of components as it creates DOM component again & again while using Key props instead helps in quick rendering as it considers the child component and quikly assign the attributes and functons assocoited from Parent Component irrespective of from where the actual data is coming from.
